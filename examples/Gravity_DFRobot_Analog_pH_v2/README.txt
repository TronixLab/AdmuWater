Gravity: Analog pH Meter Pro V2.0 (SEN0169)

Description:
As an upgraded version of pH meter V1, this product greatly improves the precision and user experience. The onboard voltage regulator chip supports the wide voltage supply of 3.3~5.5V, 
which is compatible with 5V and 3.3V main control boards (Arduino/ESP32).
The output signal filtered by hardware has low jitter. 
The software library adopts the two-point calibration method, and can automatically identify two standard buffer solutions (4.0 and 7.0), so simple and convenient.
It uses an industry electrode and has a built-in simple, convenient, practical connection and long life, very suitable for online monitoring.

Notes:
1. The BNC connector and the signal conversion board must be kept dry and clean, otherwise, it will affect the input impedance, resulting in an inaccurate measurement. 
If it is damp, it needs to be dried (sensitive to connector impedance and measurement can easily affect by its environment).
2. The sensitive glass bubble in the head of the pH probe should avoid touching the hard material (any damage or scratches will cause the electrode to fail).
3. The pH probe should not be connected to the signal conversion board without the power supply for a long time.
4. The bottle cap of the probe contains protective liquid (3.3mol/L KCL). As long as there is still protective liquid in the bottle cap, it will not affect the life and accuracy of the probe.

Features:
* 3.3~5.5V wide voltage input
* Hardware filtered output signal, low jitter
* Gravity connector and BNC connector, plug-and-play, no soldering required
* The software library supports two-point calibration and automatically identifies standard buffer solution
* Upgraded Transmitter - More Accurate and Stable (±0.1 pH @ 25℃)
* Probe Life: 7*24hours > 0.5 years (depending on the water quality)
* Cable Length: 500cm


Comments:
1. signal conversion board voltage supply of 3.3~5.5V (Arduino/ESP32 compatible).
2. two-point calibration method only (4.0 and 7.0).
3. uses EEPROM for calibration, and has temperature compensation (25℃ default) for calibration, temperature sensor (like DS18B20) is required for automatic temperature compensation.
4. it is stable and has an acuuracy of ±0.1 pH @ 25℃
5. since analog measurement, it is sensitive to BNC connector impedance which is affected by environment.
6. pH sensor probe (glass bubble) is sensitive. any damage or scratches will cause the electrode to fail.
7. the sensor cable length is 500cm, since analog if we significantly increase cable length may affect the readings.
